/*
  class declaration consists of the class name, class header(specifying its type parameters, primary constructor)
  and the class body, both the header and the body are optional; if the class has no body curly braces can be omitted

  class in kotlin have a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructor.
  The primary constructor is part of the class header: it goes after the class name
  e.g class Person constructor(firstName: String) {/*...*/}

  primary constructor cannot contain any code, initialization code can be placed in initializer blockwhich are prefixed with init keyword
